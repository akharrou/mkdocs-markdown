Synopsis \u2693\ufe0e Mkdocs is a python script, downloadable through pip , that generates a static documentation website. Documentation source files are written in Markdown , and the website generation is configured with a single YAML file. Beyond configurable, the generated website is extensible and overrideable in its functionality and in its look, through third-party plugins and themes but also by integrating your own python functions/modules, css stylesheets, javascripts, assets (SVG icons), etc. Additionally the Markdown language is also extendable with extensions like Pymdown-Extensions . The best theme is hands down Mkdocs-Material , elegant and fully extendable .
