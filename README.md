> **Conclusion**, it's pretty good, don't know if it's really that scalable thought (i.e 1000+ pages). However this is definetly a goto for small projects, products, and small knowledge bases –– anywhere between 1~100ish pages should be fine. You could however with [Spotify's `monorepo` plugin](https://github.com/backstage/mkdocs-monorepo-plugin) make this scalable, see more [on their original blog post](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/10/01/solving-documentation-for-monoliths-and-monorepos/), albeit with compromises, e.g. breaking up your knowledge base in a bunch of separate repos.
